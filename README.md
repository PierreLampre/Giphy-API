# Giphy-API

What we have here is a Gif search that leverages GIPHY API.  The user is invited to make a button by inputting text into the search bar and hitting "Make a button".  When that button is clicked, GIPHY will search its database for 10 gif that match the button's text.

I also decided to style it in a few different ways: 

Disco: Just what it sounds like, flashing colors and 70's font.

Shoebelt: My take on Bootstrap styling, built from scratch without using Bootstrap.

Hot Bath: An homage to my favorite place to rejuvenate, now with gif getting buttons!

Blue and Yellow: To be revisited and built out.
